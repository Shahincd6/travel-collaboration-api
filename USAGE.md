## AI-Assisted Problem Solving

### Complex SQL Query Development
Challenge: Creating efficient queries for the three mandatory reports
AI Solution: ChatGPT helped design optimized queries with proper JOINs, GROUP BY clauses, and aggregate functions

Example - Top Cities Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  location as city,
  COUNT(*) as activity_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id.trip_id) as trip_count
FROM activities a
JOIN itinerary_days id ON a.itinerary_day_id = id.id
JOIN trips t ON id.trip_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN trip_collaborators tc ON t.id = tc.trip_id
WHERE t.owner_id = $1 OR tc.user_id = $1
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY activity_count DESC, trip_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Challenge: Implementing flexible permission system
AI Solution: ChatGPT designed a middleware system that checks user roles dynamically

Key Implementation:
- Dynamic role checking based on trip ownership and collaboration
- Flexible middleware that accepts different permission levels
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### Error Handling & Validation
Challenge: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
AI Solution: Generated validation schemas and error handling patterns

Benefits:
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Comprehensive input validation using express-validator
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

## Critical Thinking & Customization

While AI tools provided significant assistance, human oversight was crucial for:

### 1. Business Logic Validation
- Reviewed AI-generated code for business rule compliance
- Ensured proper data relationships and constraints
- Validated security implementations

### 2. Performance Optimization
